# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows the user to pick one of three options (rock, paper, or scissors) and then compares it to a randomly chosen option by the computer. Based on the comparison, the game determines whether the user wins, loses, or draws.

## Features:
- **User Interaction**: Users can select their choice by clicking on the corresponding image (rock, paper, or scissors).
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the user's score, displaying it on the scoreboard.
- **Result Display**: After each round, the game displays the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the result (win, lose, or draw).
- **Play Again Option**: Users can restart the game by clicking on the "PLAY AGAIN" button after a round ends.

## Project Structure:
- **HTML Structure**: The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the game, including elements for the scoreboard, user's hand choices, computer's hand choice, and result display.
- **CSS Styling**: The CSS file (`style.css`) provides styles and layouts for the game elements, including positioning, colors, and visual effects.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: The JavaScript file (`script.js`) implements the game logic, handling user input, generating random computer choices, determining the result, updating the score, and controlling the flow of the game.
